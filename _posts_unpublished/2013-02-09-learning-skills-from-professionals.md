    Weak angle. Content is not really useful by itself.
    This is more a *musing* than a useful post.

<!-- Assumption: Learning the fundamentals of a profession grants certain skills to the student. Thus if you want to learn certain skills, it's often useful to learn the fundamentals of a profession where that skill is necessary. -->

I enjoy learning new things. Particularly I enjoy learning new skills that I can apply during my day-to-day tasks. To be most efficient, I often try to learn from individuals in different professions since it is usually [fastest to learn from others].

Here a couple of professions I have interacted with and (what I view as) fundamental skills for each:

* **Computer Programmer, Software Engineer**
    * How to automate anything.
    * Rigor. Elimination of ambiguity.
        * Enforced strictly by compilers.
    * How to reason about and build complex systems through repeated use of abstraction and reduction. **(Advanced Skill)**
* **Mathematician**
    * How to see and combine patterns.
    * Explicit thought.
    * Rigor.
        * Enforced by peers (through proof verification).
* **Statistician** > Mathematician
    * How to make justified decisions.
* **Lawyer**
    * How to interpret and communicate the ambiguity in legal code.
    * Rigor.
        * Enforced infrequently by lawsuit proceedings.
* **Accountant**
    * How to memorize and bend arbitrary rules for maximum benefit.
* **Technical Writer**
    * How to communicate detailed information through the written word to professionals.
* **Marketer**
    * How to persuade and communicate information quickly to a specific target audience.
        * Enforced through metrics such as CPM, CPC, and many others.
* **Graphic Artist**
    * How to render a description to high quality graphics.
* **Serial Entrepreneur**
    * How to make reasonable decisions in the presence of extreme ambiguity.
    * How to quickly determine what products or services are desirable to build or offer.
    * How to network effectively with others.
