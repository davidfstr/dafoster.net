# Jekyll
# NOTE: Cannot upgrade Jekyll to 4.x because RDiscount support removed.
#       See thread: https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/jekyll-4-0-many-markdown-engines-removed-reason/5912
#       May need to advocate to reinstate support, especially if GitHub Pages
#       updates to Jekyll 4.x in the future.
