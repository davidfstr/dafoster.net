<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

I initially discovered computers when I was 4 and starting programming them at 6.
Since then, programming has been one of my most enduring passions.
Witness my large number of [personal projects](/projects/).

Beyond that I enjoy:

* reading;
* learning about languages (both spoken and programming);
* teaching;
* playing badminton and pool; and
* watching the occasional anime series.
