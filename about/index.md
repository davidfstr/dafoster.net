My name is **David Foster** and I enjoy developing software for fun and profit,
with the aim of making a positive difference in the world.

I co-founded [TechSmart],
which seeks to bring world-class computer science education to K-12 students.
I specifically engineer the [TechSmart Platform] website.

[TechSmart Platform]: /projects/techsmart-platform/

My open source contributions that are probably the most well-known include:

* maintaining [RDiscount], Ruby bindings to the Discount Markdown implementation;
* [TypedDict's initial implementation] and other typechecking extensions in Python & mypy;
* [SSA subtitle support in HandBrake]; and
* enhancements to [Django].

<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

I initially discovered computers when I was 4 and starting programming them at 6.
Since then, programming has been one of my most enduring passions.
Witness my large number of [personal projects](/projects/).

Beyond that I enjoy:

* reading;
* learning about languages (both spoken and programming);
* teaching;
* kayaking, visiting gardens; and
* watching the occasional anime series.
