My name is **David Foster** and I enjoy developing software for fun and profit.

I co-founded [TechSmart],
which seeks to bring world-class computer science education to K-12 students.
I specifically own the [TechSmart Platform] website.

<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

I initially discovered computers when I was 4 and starting programming them at 6.
Since then, programming has been one of my most enduring passions.
Witness my large number of [personal projects](/projects/).

Beyond that I enjoy:

* reading;
* learning about languages (both spoken and programming);
* teaching;
* kayaking, visiting gardens; and
* watching the occasional anime series.
