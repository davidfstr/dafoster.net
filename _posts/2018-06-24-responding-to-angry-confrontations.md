I am fortunate to have experienced anger only a few times in my life where that anger was directed at me. However this also means that I have less experience in responding well to anger when it *does* come my way.

Here I would like to give a specific process for how I might best respond to an angry confrontation in a respectful and non-defensive manner.

I have not actually made use of this process yet, so I don't really know how it performs. I would love to [hear from you] if you are willing to share your own experiences in responding to confrontations or have your own process.

[hear from you]: /contact

* **Situation 1**: An opening salvo of angry or tactfully frustrated **SMS messages** or an **email** is received.

    * <p>Try upgrade to high-bandwidth rich communication immediately: **Call** (without negotiating scheduling). Be **prepared to leave voicemail** with the first few talking points.</p>

* **Situation 2**: An opening salvo of angry or tactfully frustrated **voice-to-voice** or **face-to-face** statements is made by an other.

    * (If asked in-person why I'm looking away to open this checklist, which could be interpreted as disrespectful: "This is an important and delicate situation, so I want to be sure I respond in the best way I know. Please allow me a moment to orient myself.")

    * (If teased or mocked for using a checklist: "Emotionally charged situations are not natural for me. I have found checklists to be helpful in navigating them.")

* **Begin rich communication**

    * **Acknowledge feelings**: "I see you're upset."

    * **Tentatively engage**: "Do you want to talk about it now?"

        * <p>No? "Okay. We'll talk later."</p>
    
    * **Listen**, without interrupting, withholding immediate response.

        * Observe the other's **concrete observations** and **generalizations**. Especially those not in the opening salvo.

        * Observe **repeated generalizations**, which are likely to be more impactful to or more strongly held by the other.
    
    * **Consider**. Form an initial interpretation silently.

        * <p>**Beware of Confabulation**: When folks are angry (or otherwise experiencing very strong emotions) it is not uncommon for assertions or accusations they make to be after-the-fact confabulated generalizations to explain their initial emotional reactions. **Focus on concrete details** they cite - which are more reliable - rather than on generalizations.</p>
    
    * **Replay** conversation back, focusing on the other's concrete assertions and acknowledging generalizations, regardless of agreement.

        * <p>Verify that details were conveyed and understood, regardless of agreement.</p>

    * **Discuss**:

        * Contribute **my own concrete observations**, focusing on any that are related to the other's generalizations.

        * If the other has made generalizations that I disagree with, **explain my own alternate interpretations/generalizations** based on the additional concrete observations that I (and now we) have at our disposal. Never directly contradict the other's generalizations.

        * If it is determined that a **transgression** (i.e. an action inconsistent with values or norms) did in fact occur, **apologize**. **Reacknowledge** how it made the other feel.

        * Brainstorm **how to move forward** in the current situation.

        * Brainstorm **how to reduce the likelihood of a similar undesirable situation in the future**.

That's all folks. Maybe this checklist or the philosophy underlying it will be of assistance to you in responding to a confrontation.
