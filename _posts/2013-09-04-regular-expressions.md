Regular expressions are a concise way to search and transform strings using patterns. They are available in numerous text editors and programming languages.

Below are some slides I presented to the Splunk Seattle office about regular expressions. I introduce basic regular expressions and show the intermediate and advanced syntax which I use commonly. The second-to-last slide has a nice cheatsheet for the subset of the regex language that I actually use.

If you're lucky enough to be in a language with monadic parser combinators (like Haskell's Parsec), consider using them instead.
