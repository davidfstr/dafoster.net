title: How to upload from OS X Photos to Facebook (2016)
tags: [Productivity]

---

The OS X Photos program has a built-in Share button that can post selected photos directly to Facebook. However it has the following limitations:

* Photos are not uploaded in high quality.
* Photos are not uploaded in the correct order. Neither the order of selection nor the order the photos were taken is used exactly.
* Photos cannot be uploaded to a new album, only an existing one.

Therefore I recommend the following procedure to upload photos from OS X Photos to Facebook:

1. In OS X Photos, **select all photos** that you want to upload by holding Command and clicking each photo.

2. From the menubar, choose: **File > Export > Export N photos...**

3. In the Facebook web interface, choose **"Create Album"**, selecting all the photo files that you exported in the previous step.

    * Ensure the **"High Quality" checkbox** is checked.

Done.
