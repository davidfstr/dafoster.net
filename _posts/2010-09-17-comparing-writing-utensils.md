My experience using various kinds of writing utensils in school...

<i>&gt; = "is better than"</i>

### Why Pens > Pencils

* Don't smudge ∴ Archive well
* Force you to think about what you are writing
    * Mistakes are more costly, since you cannot simply use an eraser on pen
* Have brighter contrast ∴ Easier to read

### Why Mechanical Pencils > Traditional Pencils

* Don't need to be sharpened ∴
    * No sawdust to clean up
    * No special sharpener hardware needed
    * Lifetime is not limited to a certain number of sharpenings
        * Lifetime only limited to when the m-pencil is lost
* Seem to resist smearing in the short term
    * (but pens still win in the long term)

### Why Writing Utensils > Computer Keyboards [for creative projects]

* Force you to think about what you are writing
    * It takes a long time (comparatively) to write individual words,
      which gives you time to think about what you are writing
    * Mistakes are more costly, since you cannot just delete words
* Force you to think about the structure of what you are writing
    * Mistakes are more costly, since you cannot just cut and paste sections 
      which are poorly laid out in the first place
* No mental overhead
    * Using computers always incurs at least a small bit of mental overhead 
      that interferes with the creative process
* Automatic revision control (in the case of pen)
    * It's easier to strike through (rather than erase) rejected ideas with 
      pen, so these ideas are preserved for future analysis, which sometimes 
      comes in handy

### Why Computer Keyboards > Writing Utensils [for non-creative projects]

* Typing speed is much higher
    * Gets even better if you use typing expansion software
    * Gets even better if you use dictation software [for prose]
    * Gets even better if you use a stenotype machine
* Hyperlinks are easy to create and maintain
    * This is especially powerful when writing reference documents
