[Crystal] is a **website downloader program** that is intended to save websites for long-term archival, even after the original site has fallen off the internet.

Today's release brings the ability to download sites requiring login, better-support for infinite-scrolling sites, a [read-only mode], and a [CLI shell]. See the [release notes] for more information.
