I love programming. It tickles me when I stumble across a new programming language that lets me express concepts in a more clear and direct fashion. I love the cleanness and order than results after a good round of refactoring[^1]. I enjoy the challenge of hacking away at a fiddly problem and testing all the cases to get a correct and bulletproof solution. 

However I have realized programming is merely an activity. It is a *means*, not an *end*. My work is not inherently valuable because I have created a piece of software. Rather it is because I have created software *that solves somebody's problem*.[^2]

Therefore it is the *problem* that deserves the most attention if you want to make a difference that people care about. In that vein I have been learning about the precepts of Customer Development and Customer Discovery, which deals with how to efficiently interact with customers to discover a problem that they care about.[^3]

Direct customer interaction, such as through in-person interviews of the general public, is way outside my comfort zone. However I will perservere. I think it is a very important skill for actually making a dent in the universe.[^4]


[^1]: *Refactoring* is a systematic method for code cleanup: improving the structure of existing code without changing its behavior. I highly recommend the book [Refactoring](http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672) if you want a deep-dive into the topic.

[^2]: <!-- Speculation: --> Business majors & managers recognize early on the importance of solving business problems. After all, their training is around organizing other people to solve problems they identify. (Although I feel they often focus overly on managing and not enough on problem identification.)

[^3]: For a great practical workboard around Customer Discovery (which is the first quarter of Customer Development), I highly recommend Ash Maurya's [Running Lean](http://www.amazon.com/Running-Lean-Iterate-Works-OReilly/dp/1449305172). For a full overview of Customer Development, I recommend Steve Blank's [The Four Steps to the Epiphany](http://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Successful-Strategies/dp/0976470705).
