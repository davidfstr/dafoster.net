title: RDiscount 2.0.7 released!
tags: [Personal, Software]

---

It has been just over two years since RDiscount 1.6.8 (the previous version) was posted.  
As the new maintainer, I intend to provide updates a bit more frequently. :-)

Update to the latest version with:

<pre>gem update rdiscount</pre>

## What's New?

* [Footnotes] - from *PHP Markdown Extra*
* Superscript tweaks
    * Be more picky about what comes before a ^ if weâ€™re superscripting.
    * Modify superscript grabbing so that it grabs parenthetical and alphanumeric blocks.
* Other bug fixes
    * Table-of-contents generation will no longer crash for header items containing links.
    * Adjacent new-style [link]s are no longer incorrectly combined.

## What's Next?

RDiscount 2.1.5 will be the next release of RDiscount. Planned features include:

* Fenced code blocks
    * [backtick-delimited] - from *GitHub Flavored Markdown*
    * [tilde-delimited] - from *PHP Markdown Extra*

## Who am I?

I should also introduce myself: I am [David Foster], the new maintainer for RDiscount.

Since I am using RDiscount on my personal website, you can expect continued updates as major new features are introduced in the underlying [Discount] library.
