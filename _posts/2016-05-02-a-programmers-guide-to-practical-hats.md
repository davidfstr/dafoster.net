Why wear a hat?

* protect against cold air
* protect against cold wind
* protect against sun
* be easy to spot or recognize
* look cool; look distinctive
* declare social identity to others; attract folks with similar identity

When to especially wear a hat?

* extreme weather
    - very cold or windy
    - very sunny
* long exposure to weather
    - going boating
    - going hiking for > 2 hours
* weak or missing natural protections
    - reduced or no hair
    - sensitive skin
* if you want to appear older or more mature, as these kinds of people are more likely to know how to use, afford, and store hats

There are a *huge* number of hat types. Here are a few kinds I work with commonly:

### "Paperboy" / "taxi driver" <small>(One-piece cap.)</small>
