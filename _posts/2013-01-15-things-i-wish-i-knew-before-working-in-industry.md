In April 2008, a representative from IBM gave a presentation at Georgia
Tech about things he wished he knew before working in the the software
industry. I have found his advise to be very useful at various points during
my career. Sadly I have lost the presenter's name.

Here is my outline of his presentation. **Emphasized** points are ones I've found
to be particularly useful.

### Technology

* Future: integration
* Needed: ease-of-use & less complexity
* Do *not* reinvent wheels!
    * you'll never finish the project


### Technical Knowledge

* Learn to learn
* Don't need to take a class to learn something
* Learn a little about a lot of things
* Read news highlights from worthwhile sources

### Problem Solving

* **Build a network of people. Asking for advice is quicker than learning the hard way.**
* There is always more than one way to do something.  
  Weigh the pros/cons of each – then pick and choose.
* Innovate *before* you execute. Think critically before you act.

### Business & Technology

* **Technology adoption is driven by *business*. (practicality)**
* Business is nothing without technology.  
  Technology is nothing without business.
* If you build a better mousetrap, they will not come.
* A project, no matter how advanced, is doomed for failure without a paying customer.
* Think about TCO (*total* cost of ownership) and ROI (return on investment).  
  You must always justify your returns.
* **Communication with *managers* and *customers* is vital!**  
  If you can't get someone to adopt your solution, what's the point?
* There is a difference between removing barriers and creating incentive (for a customer to switch to my project/product). You need both.

### Promotions

* It's not *what* you know.  
  It's not *who* you know.  
  **It's *who* knows *what* you know.**
* Doing more of the same is not enough.
    * Need to try new things – take on more responsibility.
* Doing what is asked is not enough.
* Ask you manager what the expectations are.

### Working with Others

* **Credit + gratitude are not limited resources.**
    * Say thank you!
    * Give credit where due.
* Be ambitious but be humble.
* Don't make assumptions about others.
    * Give people the benefit of the doubt.
* "Your lack of planning does not mean I need to treat your request as urgent."
* Do what you say you will. Keep your word.
    * reliable
    * dependable
* The best humor is *self-deprecating*.
* There is always someone faster, smarter, and better looking.

### Managers

* They don't have a magic wand. They don't automatically fix problems.
* Managers do not have a superset of the employees' (team members') knowledge.
* Managers can't read minds. Don't assume. Communicate explicitly.
* You are responsible for your own career. But ask for help.

### You and Your Job

* Your job is what you make of it. Don't be confined by a job description.
* Work/Life balance doesn't have good default settings. You must do *explicit* actions.
    * plan
    * schedule for success
* You are not your job. Do not define yourself like this.

### Workers

* **We're employed to *add value*, not spend money.**
* It's easy to stay busy, but are you accomplishing anything *worthwhile*?
    * don't needlessly clutter your schedule
* If you aren't looking at it from a *customer perspective*, you aren't looking at it.
* **You can't do everything. Pick what you *won't* do.** (The world won't end.)

### Employment

* Don't expect your first job to be your dream job. Look for a *path*, not an *endpoint*.
* Be willing to stretch your comfort zone.
    * geographically, work type, etc.
    * Otherwise you'll stagnate.
* Know your employer's business model.
    * Examples:
        * HP = selling ink;
        * Microsoft = selling Office and Windows;
        * Apple = iPod and (to some extent) Macs
    * Take a look at the annual reports for your company.
* **Get *internships*, even if with competitors, maybe even delaying graduation.**
    * It gives experience.
    * Increases employment opportunities.
* Start looking and prepare much earlier.

### Successful Employment

* If you want to make a difference, look for chaos.  
  Stable environments offer little opportunity.
* Good employees *deal* with challenges instead of pouting. *Adapt*.
* Stay above the commodity line (with regard to skill set and type of work done).

### Life

* Understand other people's *motivations*.
    * Makes it easier to find new ways of solving the underlying goal.
* Define your values and goals.
    * ex: What type of job do you want?
* Your *behaviors* should support your goals.
* Expect your goals to change. Success is dynamic.
* Don't let *others* define success for you.
* You can get rich by getting more or *wanting less*.
* Life is one great balancing act.
    * There's no single right way of doing things.
    * Balancing your priorities and goals is important.
