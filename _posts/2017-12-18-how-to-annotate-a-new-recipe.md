title: How to annotate a new recipe
tags: [Cooking]

When trying a new recipe for the first time I annotate it to highlight certain important parts. An annotated recipe is easier to follow when cooking. And the process of annotating a recipe forces me to actually read the recipe.

Here is a recipe that I've already annotated:

### In the ingredients list

* **Underline implicit preparation steps** like "chopped", "minced", "defrosted". Mark their ordering with ①, ②, ③, etc. With such implicit steps marked you'll remember to do them even though they may not be in the main recipe steps.

* **Put a [ bracket around ingredient clusters** that are added or used at the same time.

* **Mark fresh or uncommon ingredients with ●** that I'll definitely need to buy. **Mark pantry ingredients that eventually expire with ○** since I might need to buy them. All other items are pantry ingredients which never expire and don't usually need to be worried about.

* **Draw a ▭ rectange around key ingredients**. These give the primary flavor and should only be substituted with extra care.

* **Mark any substitutions with ≈**

### In the recipe steps

* Mark any **cooking times** like "12 to 15 minutes"

* Mark any words that imply the use of **non-standard equipment** like "sift" or "poach"
