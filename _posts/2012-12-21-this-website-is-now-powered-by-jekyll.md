And this is my first post using the new system. Articles are a lot easier to
write, so I will be posting more frequently.

Previously this site was powered by the [Drupal] engine. I found it overly
complex to maintain, especially for a single-user blog and portfolio website.
For more details see my post [Why I no longer use Drupal].
