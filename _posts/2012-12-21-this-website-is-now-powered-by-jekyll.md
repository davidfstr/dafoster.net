And this is my first post using the new system. Articles are a lot easier to write, so I will be posting more frequently.

Previously this site was powered by the [Drupal] engine. I found it overly complex to maintain, especially for a single-user blog and portfolio website. For more details see my post [Why I no longer use Drupal](/articles/2012/12/16/why_i_no_longer_use_drupal/).

[Drupal]: http://drupal.org
