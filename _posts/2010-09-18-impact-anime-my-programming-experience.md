It occurs to me that anime has been an important driver for improving my programming abilities.

For example:

* I did my own [implementation of the Kisekae Set System] (KiSS),
  a digital paper doll system which often featured anime characters.
    * My very first exposure to anime was to the characters of Wedding Peach, 
      via an included doll file with the French KiSS viewer by John Stiles.
    * Taught me how to write directly to graphics buffers, in both C and
      later Java.
* I initially picked up Java when I was writing **RealMediaFixer**,
  a repairer of RealMedia video files. CodeWarrior's implementation of the
  C++ iostream classes had a broken buffered stream implementation,
  so I switched to Java to use its rock solid BufferedOutputStream 
  implementation.
    * Initial use was to repair [Ranma] episodes that I downloaded over HTTP,
      on dialup!
* I implemented [my own client and server for the Hotline protocol],
  through which I got most of my anime prior to the introduction of
  BitTorrent.
* Today I am [enhancing support for transcoding soft subtitles in HandBrake]
  so that I can watch new anime on the bus.
