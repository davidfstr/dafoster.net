I recently upgraded from an iPod Touch to an iPhone 3GS. I hate contracts, so I
bought the 3GS off-contract from a seller on Craigslist. (And I timed my 
purchase to coincide with the release of the iPhone 4, so lots of people were 
dumping their own 3GS devices.)

I am routinely in WiFi hotspots: at home, enroute to work, and at work, so I 
usually put the iPhone 3GS in "Airplane Mode", where the wireless radios are 
disabled, to conserve battery life. Therefore I effectively use my iPhone like 
a better iPod Touch most of the time.

From purely a specification point of view, the differences are:

In practical terms, this translates to:

* <b>I never get completely lost*</b>
    * The combination of GPS plus internet everywhere means that I always know
      where I am on the map.
    * I can also get instant directions from my current location to an
      arbitrary destination. I usually take public transit, but this works with
      cars as well.
* **The iPhone is a better boombox**
    * I use both devices as portable external sound systems while I work.
      The better speaker quality of the iPhone is nice to have.
* **The iPhone user interface is more responsive**
    * ...thanks to the better CPU.
* **The iPhone needs to be recharged slightly more often**
    * ...thanks to the shorter battery life.
* **I never miss calendar reminders anymore**
    * Calendar reminders (including work meeting reminders) are not only 
      audible on the iPhone but also produce a noticeable vibration.
* **I can use Shazam to identify random music I hear**
    * ...thanks to the built-in microphone.
    * **2012 Update:** This actually doesn't work very well.
* **I can make phone calls if I really want to**
    * The microphone makes it feasable. Not just for normal calls, but VoIP 
      internet calls as well.
    * With a phone plan, you can make the normal calls as well.*

<i>* Requires phone plan, with associated subscription costs.</i>

## The uneasy marriage with AT&T

I hate expensive monthly fees. Here in the USA, the only officially 
supported carrier is AT&T, which charges at least $70/month. I don't even use 
the voice plan, so I'm being overcharged rather significantly at the moment.

T-Mobile is another option for those willing to unlock their iPhones. They 
have less expensive plans, to the tune of $40/month, which I'm much in favor 
of. I intend to unlock my iPhone when I get some spare time in the next month 
or so. After all, it's costing me $30/month to delay.

**2012 Update:** T-Mobile is rumored to be carrying the iPhone sometime in
2013. I just hope it isn't "too little, too late."

**2012 Update:** I am still using the same iPhone 3GS today.
