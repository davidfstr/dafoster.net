## Technical & Tools

* JavaScript ecosystem.
    - Enormous but highly fragmented.
    - Infrastructure for many basic things either does not exist or
      the community has not standardized on a particular tool.
        - Includes & Modules
            - raw &lt;script&gt; tags
            - node-require
            - AMD-require (require.js)
        - Class Declarations
            - too many alternatives to name
            - My favorite one actually comes from a [blog post](http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/).
        - Testing
        - Code Coverage
        - Documentation
        - Lint &ndash; *JSHint, JSLint*
        - <p>Minification &ndash; *many choices*</p>
* <p>PHP ecosystem.</p>
* <p>Multi-layer system design, as occurs in the new [Splunk App Framework]</p>
* GitHub.
    - Good code reviews.
      Not as good at Microsoft's CodeFlow or Google's Mondrian though.
    - <p>Most awesome developer community I've ever seen.</p>
* StackOverflow.
    - <p>Quickly lookup answers to technical questions.</p>
* JIRA.
    - A really good task tracking system.
    - Far better than the Product Studio system I used at Microsoft.

## Social

* <p>*Tactfully* give feedback (in code reviews, etc)</p>
* <p>Interviewing & hiring</p>
* <p>Mentoring</p>
* Talking with customers
    - I was a booth guy at the 2012 Splunk .conf conference.
    - <p>I have some friends who use Splunk too at their workplaces.</p>
